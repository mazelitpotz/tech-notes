# Quitting Vim

Quitting Vim is more important than opening it when starting. Other common terminal quitting keys have no use here.

The correct sequence is â†’ `:q`.

You use column (`:`) followed by a `q`, as per "Quitting". That's simple to remember. Even the column at the front has a meaning, but for now, only remember that you need it.
