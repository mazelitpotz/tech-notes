# Vim

There are tons of manuals about Vim out there, and I don't want to build a copy of those. I want to write some atomic notes explaining how I use (and have learned to use) it.

- [Quitting Vim](vim-quit.md)
- [Vim Motion](vim-motion.md)
- [Modify a file in Vim](modify-a-file-in-vim.md)
- [Initial Horizontal Motions](horizontal-vim-motions-intro.md)
- [Move to the Start/End of the line](move-start-end-line.md)
