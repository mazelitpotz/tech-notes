# Tech Notes

This is a public repo where I publish atomic notes documenting the software and tools I use. I often like to try new things, and I'd like to keep track of what I am doing.

There's not a specific order. I'll start talking about a Vim-like command, but if I get obsessed with something new, I can easily change my topic. I'll write everything in markdown, with all files stored.
